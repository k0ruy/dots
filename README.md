The most important packages are:
`pfetch btop exa feh git github-cli gh neovim nvim-packer pulseaudio ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd`

I include weather using OpenWeatherMap API. If you want to use it you will have to create an account and ask for an API key, then substitute the key inside the `~/scripts/weather.py` file.
Below I put an image of the updated desktop.

The configuration files for my Linux desktop.

# Installation

> ⚠️ &nbsp; Cone the repo and substitute the folders. I recommend to create backups of what you modify, so that you don't lose your configurations if something goes wrong

# Key Bindings

A few notes on the bindings:

- Keys combined with the `Super` key are reserved for OS and WM-related actions.  
- Arrows and `hjkl` keys are interchangeable.

# Neovim Config

This [config](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim) has a decent amount of work and is basically a fully fledged IDE. I changed a couple of things in my config and to configure neovim ***in theory*** should be enough to open `nvim` in a terminal and running `:PackerSync`. Be sure to have the latest version of nvim and not the one installed by the package manager.

*Desktop with my terminal, nvim and btop open:*

> ℹ️ &nbsp; I try to keep all of the key bindings in [this file](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/blob/main/.config/nvim/lua/alex/key-bindings.lua).
